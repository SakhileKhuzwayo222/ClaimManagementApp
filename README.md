# Monthly Claims Management System

## Overview

The **Monthly Claims Management System** is a web application designed to streamline and automate the process of managing monthly claims for contracts. It allows users to submit, review, and track claims for different contracts, ensuring timely approval and payment. The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contracts, claims, and claim statuses, providing an efficient workflow for all stakeholders involved.

## Features

- **Contract Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete contract information.
- **Claim Management**: Submit claims, view claim details, and update or delete claims.
- **Claim Status Tracking**: Track the progress of claims through various statuses (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).
- **Approval Workflow**: A built-in approval process for contract claims.
- **Monthly Reporting**: Generate reports on submitted claims for each contract by month.
- **User Authentication**: Role-based access control for users with different permissions (e.g., Admin, Manager, Contractor).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET MVC
- **Frontend**: Razor Views, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **ORM**: Entity Framework
- **Language**: C#

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio 2022 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [.NET Framework 4.8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
- Entity Framework

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MonthlyClaimsManagement.git
cd MonthlyClaimsManagement
```

### 2. Set up the Database

- Open **SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS).
- Create a new database named `ClaimsDB`.
- Update the connection string in the **appsettings.json** (or Web.config) file to point to your database:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=ClaimsDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```

- Run migrations or use SQL scripts to set up the necessary tables, which may include:
  - Contracts
  - Claims
  - ClaimStatuses
  - Users (for authentication and roles)

### 3. Build the Solution

- Open the solution in Visual Studio.
- Restore NuGet packages if prompted.
- Build the solution by selecting `Build > Build Solution`.

### 4. Run the Application

- Press `F5` or click the **Run** button to start the application.
- The application will launch in your browser, showing the dashboard or login page.

## Database Schema

The following tables form the foundation of the system:

1. **Contracts**
   - `ContractID` (Primary Key)
   - `ContractName`
   - `Client`
   - `StartDate`
   - `EndDate`
   - `Description`

2. **Claims**
   - `ClaimID` (Primary Key)
   - `ContractID` (Foreign Key)
   - `ClaimAmount`
   - `ClaimDate`
   - `StatusID` (Foreign Key)
   - `SubmittedBy`

3. **ClaimStatuses**
   - `StatusID` (Primary Key)
   - `StatusName` (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected)

4. **Users**
   - `UserID` (Primary Key)
   - `Username`
   - `PasswordHash`
   - `Role` (e.g., Admin, Contractor, Manager)

## Usage

### Contract Operations

- **View Contracts**: See a list of all contracts with details such as name, client, and duration.
- **Add a Contract**: Use the "Create" option to add a new contract with relevant details like the client name, contract duration, and description.
- **Edit Contracts**: Modify existing contract details such as client name or contract period.
- **Delete Contracts**: Remove contracts that are no longer active.

### Claim Operations

- **Submit a Claim**: Create a new claim for a contract, specifying the claim amount and the date.
- **View Claims**: View submitted claims, including their current status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
- **Update Claims**: Modify existing claims to change their amount or re-submit them.
- **Delete Claims**: Remove claims that are invalid or incorrectly submitted.

### Status Tracking

- Track the progress of claims through the following statuses:
  - **Pending**: The claim is submitted but awaiting approval.
  - **Approved**: The claim is reviewed and approved.
  - **Rejected**: The claim is rejected and may need to be resubmitted.

### Monthly Reports

- Generate monthly reports that summarize the claims submitted for each contract, showing total amounts and their statuses.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Issues**: Ensure that the connection string is correct and that the database tables are set up.
- **Entity Framework Migrations**: Ensure that migrations have been applied if you're using the Code First approach.
- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure that the user authentication is correctly configured in your application.

## Future Improvements

- **Notifications**: Implement email or SMS notifications when claims are approved or rejected.
- **Export Reports**: Add the ability to export monthly reports as PDF or Excel files.
- **Enhanced Approval Workflow**: Create a more detailed workflow with multiple stages of claim approval.
- **Claim Attachments**: Allow users to upload supporting documents for their claims.
- **Dashboard**: Add a dashboard that provides an overview of contracts, claims, and approvals at a glance.
